                    This project focused on mastering After Effects animation techniques and compositing workflows.
                    The main objectives were to develop proficiency in keyframe animation, motion graphics, and layer composition through a series of creative exercises.

                <h3>Pour Over Coffee</h3>
                <p class="featured-description">
                    This project draws inspiration from the classical trope of Charlie Chaplin and the aesthetic of black and white cinema from the 1920s. 
                    The film captures the elegance and charm of early cinema through meticulous color grading, silent film techniques, and period-appropriate storytelling. 
                    Using DaVinci Resolve's advanced color correction and editing tools, I crafted a nostalgic visual experience that pays homage to cinema's golden age. 
                    Every frame is carefully composed to evoke the timeless quality of silent films while maintaining modern production standards.
