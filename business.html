                <p class="featured-description">
                    Conova is a collaborative group project focused on creating personal branding for a company. 
                    As the lead researcher, I spearheaded market analysis, competitor research, and brand strategy development to establish a unique market position. 
                    Our team worked together to develop cohesive visual identity, messaging guidelines, and brand voice that resonates with the target audience. 
                    This project demonstrates my ability to lead research initiatives, synthesize insights, and guide creative direction toward achieving business objectives. 
                    Through strategic planning and collaborative effort, we crafted a comprehensive brand identity that sets the company apart in a competitive marketplace.
