                    Conova is a a rebranding strategy for Proakatemia. 
                    We felt the need for that, because the branding of Proakatemia made you assume they're more about academic part and not entrepreneurial. 
                    With our approach, we highlighted the strengths that are not utilized fully in the current brand identity. 
                    As a lead researcher, analyzing marketing and competitors we provided insights that were taken into account during the rebranding process.
                    With that, our team was successful in creating a fresh and modern brand identity that better represents Proakatemia's mission and values.

                    TasteEase is a project where we help people with eating disorders to take their medicine.
                    Many of them have difficulties with swallowing pills, so we designed a device that helps them with that.
                    In this project I was responsible for the research to factually confirm the problems and analyse our marketing capabalities.
                    By doing that, we crafted our business model and value proposition to best suit our target audience.
                    A machine that will grind pills and combine them with neutral syrups, making them easier and tastier to take.
