                <p class="featured-description">
                    This text based rpg was my first game to be made.
                    It was heavily inspired by the Adventure Time world and characters, thus you could notice some non-copyright friendly faces
                    I handcrafted each location by tracing images from the show, and then adding my own touches to them.
                    The game has cheatcodes which will allow you to skip to certain phases, items which you can use to pass encounters.
                    There's also spatial awareness gaming principle, where when narrators speaks to you, the next action is highlighted by caps.
                    The game also has 3 endings depending on your choices throughout the game and the items you pick up.
                    Overall it was a fun project to make, and I learned a lot about game design and storytelling.
