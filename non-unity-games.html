                <p class="featured-description">
                    This text-based roleplaying game was one of my first games not made in Unity, showcasing my ability to create engaging experiences across different game engines and frameworks. 
                    Built with a focus on narrative design and player choice, this game demonstrates proficiency in state management, dialogue systems, and game mechanics implementation outside the Unity ecosystem. 
                    The project highlights creative problem-solving and adaptability in game development, proving that compelling gameplay experiences can be crafted using alternative tools and technologies. 
                    Explore a rich world of text-based adventure where your choices shape the story and determine your fate.
