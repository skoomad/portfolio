                <p class="featured-description">
                    This project showcases the power and flexibility of Blender's Geometry Nodes system. 
                    Using procedural modeling techniques, I've created dynamic and parametric animations that demonstrate advanced node-based workflows. 
                    Geometry Nodes allow for non-destructive, reusable, and scalable modeling processes that can generate complex geometry on the fly. 
                    This animation explores creative possibilities through node composition, modifier stacking, and real-time visual feedback. 
                    Watch as complex geometric patterns evolve and transform, revealing the artistic potential of procedural generation in Blender.

                <h3>Early Animation Project</h3>
                <p class="featured-description">
                    This was one of my earliest animation projects where I focused on bringing existing models to life through creative keyframe animation and motion design. 
                    Using pre-built 3D models, I explored timing, spacing, and movement principles to create dynamic and engaging animations. 
                    This project represents an important stepping stone in my journey as an animator, demonstrating the fundamentals of character and object animation in Blender. 
                    Through careful composition and pacing, I learned how to tell visual stories and convey emotion through motion.

                <h3>Lego Movie</h3>
                <p class="featured-description">
                    The Lego Movie is my biggest project to date, though not necessarily my best. This ambitious endeavor showcases the scope and complexity of large-scale 3D production. 
                    The project began with TinkerCad for initial design concepts, followed by comprehensive modeling and animation in Blender where the majority of the work was completed. 
                    The final scenes were exported to Unity where I handled light baking and camera setup to achieve the desired visual presentation and performance optimization. 
                    This project demonstrates my ability to manage complex workflows across multiple software platforms, coordinate between different tools, and deliver a finished product through collaborative pipelines.

                <h3>3D Renders: DreamCastle & PaganBook</h3>
                <p class="featured-description">
                    This dual-project showcases high-quality 3D renders exploring architectural and fantasy design themes. 
                    Both projects began with conceptualization in TinkerCad for rapid prototyping and design iteration, followed by detailed modeling and rendering in Blender. 
                    DreamCastle presents an imaginative fantasy architecture with intricate details and atmospheric lighting, while PaganBook explores mystical elements and organic design principles. 
                    These renders demonstrate proficiency in material creation, lighting setup, and photo-realistic visualization techniques. 
                    Each project represents careful attention to composition, texture work, and the visual storytelling potential of 3D rendering.
