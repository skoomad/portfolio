                <p class="featured-description">
                    My cleanest project in Blender.
                    First I found a model on Mecabricks that I liked, then in Blender I broke it down to pieces, such as
                    foundation, walls, dooors and etc. Then I set up a geometry nodes and moved everything up, animating how it falls.
                    Starting with foundation and then going part by part until the roof is settled.

                <h3>Pippy Longstocking</h3>
                <p class="featured-description">
                    My first animation project, where I got a rigged model of Pippy and her horse.
                    I wanted to do something silly with her movemement and decided to go for a timestop, using Dio's ZA WARUDO SFX.
                    Animating her preparing to jump and freeze mid air, by rotating camera was fun and fruitful.
                    A small animation done quickly.

                <h3>Lego Movie</h3>
                <p class="featured-description">
                    My biggest project in Blender which I struggled with the most. 
                    Having troubles with exporting files to Unity and later finding out the models I made in Mecabricks had overlapping LEGO parts causing visual issues.
                    And animations being a bit janky due to dyssynchronization between Blender and Unity.
                    But overall I learned a lot about animating in Blender, rigging and making sure to check things twice.
                    It was a great experience and I am happy for it.

                    Small 3D models made in Tinkercad and exported in Blender, to experiment with transferring files.
                    Was not much of a complex project, but I enjoyed making them and rendering with different lighting setups.
