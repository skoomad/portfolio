                <p class="featured-description">
                    This project showcases the power and flexibility of Blender's Geometry Nodes system. 
                    Using procedural modeling techniques, I've created dynamic and parametric animations that demonstrate advanced node-based workflows. 
                    Geometry Nodes allow for non-destructive, reusable, and scalable modeling processes that can generate complex geometry on the fly. 
                    This animation explores creative possibilities through node composition, modifier stacking, and real-time visual feedback. 
                    Watch as complex geometric patterns evolve and transform, revealing the artistic potential of procedural generation in Blender.

                <h3>Early Animation Project</h3>
                <p class="featured-description">
                    This was one of my earliest animation projects where I focused on bringing existing models to life through creative keyframe animation and motion design. 
                    Using pre-built 3D models, I explored timing, spacing, and movement principles to create dynamic and engaging animations. 
                    This project represents an important stepping stone in my journey as an animator, demonstrating the fundamentals of character and object animation in Blender. 
                    Through careful composition and pacing, I learned how to tell visual stories and convey emotion through motion.
