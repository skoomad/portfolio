                <p class="featured-description">
                    Kaldera is a 2.5D game I made in Unity, inspired by Over the Garden Wall series and Pokemon games. 
                    Here my UI, physics and gameplay loop building skills were put to the test. 
                    The enemies can be found in evil looking flower fields and their quantity and level is randomized, upon entering the area.
                    You have various options in combat, and you can also recruit a party member near the house, where she lives.
                    It was a very fun project to work on.
                    In the link, there's not only a game build but also a game design document, where I followed its principles.
                    Such as spatial awareness, attribute stats(strength, dexterity) and environmental storytelling. And the lore of course.

                <p class="featured-description">
                    Bloody Meridian is my first game made on Unity. 
                    The zombies spawn all over the map, I've wroote a code for randomized spawn points in specific parts of maps, within the squares. 
                    If you kill a zombie, there's a 10% chance they drop a coin, which you can use on crates to heal up. 
                    After you kill every zombie, you win and the game is over. 
                    It was a pretty fun project that showed me the possibilities of Unity Engine. Plus this is where my first UI steps were taken too.
